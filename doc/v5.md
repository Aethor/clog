The CLOG Builder Video Manual Series Video 5

Using your Project and using Plugins

Start up the Builder start the clog builder in your lisp with:
```
    a. QuickLisp (anywhere):    (ql:quickload :clog/tools)(clog-tools:clog-builder)
    b. In an OCICL Project Dir: (asdf:load-system :clog/tools)(clog-tools:clog-builder)
```

Templates create batch files run-ql(.bat) and run-ocicl(.bat) that can be
modified for your project needs for runing the builder simply with sbcl
(if using ecl, ccl, LispWorks, or Allegro you will need to modify it).

setup-ocicl(.bat) is also created to either convert project later to OCICL or
first time run.

Adding Plugins to your project

1. Install the plugin in
 a. location ASDF can find the plugin (like `~/common-lisp`)
 b. if using QuickLisp for example `(ql:quickload :clog-ace/tools)``
 c. if using OCICLfor example `ocicl install clog-ace`

2. Open the ASD Project Window (in project tree asd edit).

3. In the bottom right of the window choose plugin and type the name of your
    plugin. For example "clog-ace"

4. Your plugin will be loaded and any custom control added to the GUI builder
    (as login as your project is loaded with ":myproj/tools" your plugins
     should be installed and available each time you load your project.)


NOTE:

If you wish to make any plugins always available to use in the Builder see
Options -> Edit preferences.lisp

If you use the plugin though you must add it to your .asd file


NOTE (ADVANCED):
If you add plugins or dependencies at non-standard locations
you can directly add the project's location using:
```
(pushnew #P"/path/to/a/project" asdf:*central-registry* :test #'equalp)
```
in a --eval to sbcl or ecl, etc. before loading your project or the builder.
