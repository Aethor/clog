The CLOG Builder Video Manual Series Video 3

Getting Started with OCICL

Fantastic for production builds
Control over versions - can pin down versions
Secure downloads and packages

CLOG Builder has been set up to play nice without QuickLisp

OCICL is based around a single directory, your project, in its own world
    (that may have other sub projects)

Once installed you go to a new directory (or existing CLOG project)

First time setup:

ocicl setup > init
ocicl install clog

Enter your sbcl world:

sbcl --userinit init

* (asdf:load-system :clog/tools)
* (clog-tools:clog-builder)

Get the latest clog and more:
ocicl latest
